# 👑 MVP Anti-Abuse System Implemented. ( MVP WARP NEAR PORTAL )

This system is designed to prevent common abuse scenarios, 
such as players luring an MVP near a portal to safely use skills like Asura Strike and then escape through the warp with no risk.
 By enabling automatic teleportation, the MVP cannot be exploited in such a way and remains a fair challenge.

To ensure fair MVP encounters, a new anti abuse system has been introduced:
MVPs will automatically teleport when near warp portals
Works during idle movement and while chasing players
Prevents exploit tactics such as warp escaping after using high burst skills like Asura Strike
Ensures MVP fights remain fair and competitive
This system is part of our ongoing effort to maintain balanced and fair gameplay.
WITH NEW MECHANIC AND STRATEGY. 

==============================================================================================
