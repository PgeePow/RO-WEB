# Patch Update 1.3 Changelog

---

## 🛠️ NPC Changes

### Healer Readjustment
- Free healing for players **Level 66 and below**.
- **5,000 Zeny** healing fee for players **Level 66–99**.
- Buff **duration extended to 20 minutes**.

**Reason:**  
We want to support new and mid-level players by keeping early healing free, while balancing resource management for higher-level players. Extending buff duration also improves convenience during leveling and farming.

## 🛒 Item Availability

### Blue Potion in Tool Dealer
- **Blue Potion** is now available at the **Tool Dealer** for **5,000 Zeny** (official price).

**Reason:**  
We intend to maintain official pricing to ensure balance, especially for **Alchemist brewing** activities and potion economy.

---

## 🎯 Novice Training Ground Rework

- From your **second character onwards**, completing the novice training ground will reward **all basic novice items** plus **5,000 Zeny**.

**Reason:**  
This change helps players who are building alternate characters (alts) by speeding up early progression without making it too easy.

---

## 🔧 Equipment Fixes

### Garrison [1] (ID: 13104)
- Now correctly **generates random options**.
- (Previously, it had **no random options**.)

**Reason:**  
To fix a bug and align the item behavior with other equipment that supports random options, making the Garrison [1] a viable weapon choice again.

---

## 🔧 Other Features

### Increased Sitting Regeneration
- **Seated HP/SP regeneration increased to 55%.**
- (Previously was **35%**.)

**Reason:**  
To improve gameplay pacing during leveling, farming, and recovery without making potions mandatory for every play session.
