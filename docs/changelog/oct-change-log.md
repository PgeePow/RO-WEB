## 🐉 Monster Spawn Rate Adjustment

**Change:**  
Monster spawn rate density has been **reduced from 170% → 120%**.

**Reason for Change:**  
To ensure a more stable and balanced gameplay experience, the monster spawn density has been adjusted. Previously, the high spawn rate created several issues such as:

- ⚙️ **Server Performance Monitoring:**  
  The previous spawn rate placed unnecessary load on the server, especially during peak hours. Reducing the density allows us to **better monitor performance and optimize stability** for smoother gameplay.

- ⚖️ **Gameplay Balance:**  
  Excessive monster spawns made certain farming areas disproportionately rewarding, affecting overall economy and item supply. The new rate ensures **fairer progression** and **more consistent challenge levels** across maps.

- 🌍 **Improved Map Experience:**  
  With a more moderate density, players will find maps less cluttered, allowing for **better visibility, smoother movement, and reduced lag** in highly populated areas.

We’ll continue to monitor feedback and system metrics to ensure the spawn balance remains enjoyable for all players.
