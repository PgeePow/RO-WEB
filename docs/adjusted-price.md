# Adjusted Sale Item Prices

In our server, we have modified the **NPC sell prices** (the price you get when selling items to NPCs) for certain items. This change was made with careful consideration to ensure a more balanced and engaging gameplay experience.

---

## 🛠️ Why We Adjusted Sell Prices

- **Prevent Zeny Inflation**  
  Some items could be farmed and sold in high quantities, leading to rapid inflation in the economy. By adjusting their sell prices, we reduce the chance of players becoming overly wealthy too quickly and destabilizing the market.

- **Encourage Active Gameplay**  
  Instead of farming just one high-selling item repeatedly, players are encouraged to explore different areas, try different builds, and participate in events and instances for more meaningful rewards.

- **Discourage Botting/Exploits**  
  Certain items with high sell prices were being abused by bots. Lowering these prices helps reduce the profitability of automated farming and keeps the server fair for all players.

## 🎁 Benefits to Players

- **Healthier Economy**  
  With better control over Zeny sources, the value of items and effort is preserved. This makes trading, buying, and selling more meaningful.

- **More Rewarding Events**  
  With a stable economy, we can offer better rewards through quests, events, and missions without worrying about unbalancing the Zeny flow.

- **Fairer Gameplay**  
  Everyone plays on a level field, reducing the advantage of those who try to abuse item farming or bots.
