# 💖 Support the Server — Donations

Thank you for considering to support **ValkariaRO**!

Our server is built around fairness, community, and fun — and we want to keep it that way. While we do offer a **cash shop**, rest assured that:

- 🧥 **Most items are purely cosmetic**, allowing you to personalize your character without affecting balance.
- 🍬 **A few consumables are available**, but they are carefully selected to **minimize impact on gameplay**.
- ❌ **No VIP system** — everyone plays on equal footing.
- 💪 **No special stats or commands for donators** — your support keeps the server alive, not your character overpowered.
