# 🐾 Cute Pet System

The **Cute Pet System** allows adventurers to tame monsters as companions that follow, interact, and provide helpful bonuses. Pets can be loyal partners on your journey through Midgard — but they also require care and attention!

---

## 🎀 Overview

Pets are tamed monsters that follow your character around. They can:
- Add **visual flair** and companionship.
- Provide **bonus stats** when loyal.
- Be **evolved** into stronger or rarer versions (if evolution is supported).
- Occasionally **react** or display emotions when hungry, happy, or loyal.

## 🧩 How to Obtain a Pet

You’ll need three key components to tame a pet:

| Requirement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Taming Item** | Used to catch a specific monster (e.g. Poring Taming Item → Poring). |
| **Pet Egg** | Obtained after a successful taming attempt. |
| **Pet Incubator** | Used to hatch your Pet Egg. |

### 🐣 Steps to Tame:
1. Obtain the **Taming Item** for your desired monster.  
2. Use it while facing that monster in battle.  
3. A heart animation will appear — success rate depends on your luck!  
4. If successful, you’ll receive a **Pet Egg** in your inventory.  
5. Use a **Pet Incubator** to hatch your new companion.

## 💖 Pet Hunger & Intimacy

Your pet has two main stats to manage:

| Stat | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Hunger** | Drops over time. Keep it fed to prevent it from running away. |
| **Intimacy** | Increases when you feed it properly, decreases if it’s neglected or overfed. |

### 🍖 Feeding Tips:
- Each pet has a **preferred food**. Feeding the correct one increases intimacy.  
- Overfeeding may **lower intimacy** — stop feeding when it says *“I'm full.”*  
- If hunger reaches **0**, the pet may **run away** permanently.  

You can check hunger and intimacy using the **Pet Window** (`Alt + J`).

## 🍼 Feeding Type

Different types of pets have different feeding behaviors. Some require manual feeding, while others can use the **Auto-Feed** feature.

| Type | Feeding Method | Example |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Evolvable Pet** | Only manual feeding. These pets cannot use auto-feed because they can evolve into other forms. | *Poring → Mastering* |
| **Evolved Pet** | Can be auto-fed. Once evolved, these pets can use the auto-feed system. | *Angeling (evolved from Poring)* |
| **Pet Without Evolution** | Can be auto-fed. These pets have no evolution tree. | *Incubus* |

> 💡 **Tip:** To enable auto-feed, open the Pet Window (`Alt + J`) and toggle the *Auto-Feed* checkbox.

## 🌟 Pet Loyalty Levels

| Loyalty Level | Intimacy Range | Description |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Awkward | 0–99 | Recently caught or unhappy. |
| Shy | 100–249 | Starting to warm up to you. |
| Neutral | 250–749 | Friendly and calm. |
| Cordial | 750–909 | Likes you! |
| Loyal | 910–1000 | Deeply bonded. Can provide bonuses or evolve. |

!!! warning "Work in Progress"
    Pet evolution is yet to be implemented into the server. This is still work in progress.

## 🧬 Pet Evolution System

Certain pets can **evolve** into advanced forms when they reach *Loyal* status and meet specific requirements.

### 🔹 Evolution Requirements:
- The pet must be **Loyal**.
- You must have the **Evolution Item** (varies per pet).

Evolution can:
- Change your pet’s **appearance**.

> Example: *Lunatic → Angeling (via Angelic Essence)*

## ⚠️ Important Notes
