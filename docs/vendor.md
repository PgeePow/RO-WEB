## 🤝 Creating a Buying Store

Any player can set up a **Buying Store** to purchase items from others. Here are the requirements:

- **Have the Item Registered**: You must already possess at least one of the item you wish to buy.
- **Sufficient Zeny**: Make sure you have enough Zeny to pay for all the quantities you're requesting.
- **Adequate Weight Capacity**: Ensure your character can carry the purchased items.
- **Proper Location**: Buying Stores must only be set up in **authorized maps** like Alberta.

### 🧍 For Non-Merchant Classes:

If your character doesn’t belong to the Merchant class:

- Go to **Morroc Pub**
- Locate the **Black Marketeer**  
  → Use command: `/navi morocc 45/108`

The Black Marketeer allows any class to open a buying store with the same rules and requirements as Merchants.

## ⚠️ Vendor Rules

To maintain fairness and accessibility:

- ✅ Vendors and Buying Stores must be set up **only in Alberta**.
- ❌ Do **not block NPCs or warp portals** with your shop.
- ⛔ Abuse of vending or shop placement may result in removal by GMs.
