# üåÄ Random Options System

Your ValkariaRO adventure just got even more exciting! Our server features a unique **Random Options System** that adds extra stats to equipment dropped by monsters. These random bonuses make farming and hunting more rewarding, giving you the thrill of discovering powerful gear.

---

## üîç How It Works

- Only **equipment dropped by monsters** can have random options.
- Random options are grouped based on equipment type: **Melee**, **Ranged**, **Magic**, and **Armor**.
- Each eligible item will receive **3 options**, from all category.
- These options are automatically rolled when the item drops.
- All options are considered **Level 1 Tier** for now ‚Äî more may come in future expansions!
