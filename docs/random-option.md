# 🌀 Random Options System

Your ValkariaRO adventure just got even more exciting! Our server features a unique **Random Options System** that adds extra stats to equipment dropped by monsters. These random bonuses make farming and hunting more rewarding, giving you the thrill of discovering powerful gear.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

- Only **equipment dropped by monsters** can have random options.
- Random options are grouped based on equipment type: **Melee**, **Ranged**, **Magic**, and **Armor**.
- Each eligible item will receive **3 options**, from all category.
- These options are automatically rolled when the item drops.
- Random options maintained after card socket
- All options are considered **Level 1 Tier** for now — more may come in future expansions!

## 🎯 Notes

- All values are approximate and subject to balance changes.
- Some stats are more common in early slots, while specialized bonuses appear in later ones.
- There is currently no reroll or option refining system — what drops is final.
- Certain MVPs and minibosses may have a slightly higher chance to drop gear with random options.

---

## 🧪 Planned Features (Coming Soon)

- Random options maintained after enchant
