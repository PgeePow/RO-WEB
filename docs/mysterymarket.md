## ✨ How It Works

1. **Daily Refresh**  
    - Every day, the Mystery Market generates **4 random items** just for you.  
    - These offers are unique per player, so what you see may be different from your friends.

2. **Items Available**  
    - Only **Costumes** will appear.  
    - No consumables or one time use items.  
    - Each item comes with a set **Cash Points price**.

3. **Preview Before Purchase**  
     - Want to see how a costume or garment looks before buying?  
     - Use the built-in **Preview option** to try it on your character.  
     - Your appearance will return to normal after closing the preview.

4. **Purchasing Items**  
    - Spend your **Cash Points** to claim items.  
    - Unlimited Purchase
    - Once purchased, the item goes directly into your inventory.

5. **Daily Reset**  
    - The shop refreshes **once per day** (server time).  
    - Tomorrow, new items will appear!  
    - A server-wide announcement lets everyone know when the reset happens.
