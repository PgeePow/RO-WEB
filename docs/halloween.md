# 🎃 Halloween Event: Deadman’s Banquet

![Banner](assets/Halloween%20Event.png)

As the chill of October spreads across Midgard, whispers slither through the streets like creeping fog.  
The ancient gates of the **Deadman’s Banquet Hall** creak open once more, spilling forth restless spirits, endless waves of monsters, and an aura of dread so heavy it strangles the night.  

Do not expect mercy — the banquet is never short on guests, and this year, the hall hungers more than ever.  

But this Halloween, the terror is not contained within those cursed walls.  

A sinister force has stretched beyond the banquet, and **Prontera itself has fallen under the Lord of Destruction’s curse**. The once-bright capital is now cloaked in shadow; its streets are filled with whispers of the damned. Almost every person has succumbed — their forms twisted, their voices echoing with hollow despair. Only a handful remain uncorrupted, struggling to resist the suffocating darkness that coils around the city.

## 🏰 The Banquet Hall

Inside its grand yet rotting corridors, cursed chandeliers sway though no wind stirs, and tables stretch endlessly, laden with feasts untouched for centuries.  
Ghostly laughter echoes from nowhere and everywhere, masking the growls of the endless horde that lurks behind every corner.  

Adventurers who dare step inside must steel themselves, for the banquet thrives not only on flesh but also on courage — feeding off fear until nothing remains but silence.  

**Legends whisper** that those who endure its horrors may find:  
- Fragments of forgotten relics  
- Ancient masks  
- Cursed costumes  
- Charms long lost to the living  

Yet, the deeper one delves, the thinner the veil between Midgard and the abyss becomes.  
This Halloween, the Banquet is not merely an event — **it is a trial by terror**, a night where the line between the living and the damned is blurred beyond recognition.

## 📖 Lore

Slain countless times in the past, the **Lord of Death** was destined to fade into obscurity. But one night, he encountered **Satan Morroc**, who taught him forbidden arts and awakened his latent power.  

With his new abilities, he rose again — far more dangerous than ever before — and cast away his old name.  

Now reborn as the **Lord of Destruction**, he emerges during Halloween, when the barrier between life and death is weakest, to claim the mortal world.  
This time, he will not be defeated so easily.

The **Lord of Destruction is not a boss to solo.**  
He punishes arrogance, thrives on chaos, and becomes strongest at his weakest HP.  

- At low HP he chains devastating combos: **Earthquake, Meteor Storm, Power Up, and Assumptio**.  
- Requires **party coordination** to withstand his final phases.  
- Designed to be the **ultimate Halloween raid boss** — only the bravest adventurers working together will survive his wrath.
